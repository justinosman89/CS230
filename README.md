Operating Platforms

The Gaming Room was the client who wanted to design a web-based gaming application called "Draw It or Lose It." This application was inspired by the 1980s TV game "Win, Lose, or Draw." The client wanted a client-server architecture that would allow multiple teams to guess drawings generated from stock drawings. The game required unique team and game names, a database for storing game data, and the involvement of the client in testing and maintenance after development. The ultimate goal was to provide an engaging and entertaining gaming experience for the users.

In developing this documentation, I paid careful attention to capturing the client's requirements, both from a business and technical standpoint. I ensured that the software requirements were clearly defined and addressed in the design template. Additionally, I provided a comprehensive evaluation of different operating platforms and their suitability for the project, considering factors such as development requirements, client-side considerations, and development tools. By providing detailed information and analysis, I aimed to assist the client in making informed decisions and setting the direction for the development process.

Working through the design document was helpful in several ways. Firstly, it allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the client's needs and requirements before diving into the code. It provided a roadmap and a clear structure for the development process, ensuring that all crucial aspects were considered and addressed. It served as a reference point throughout the development process, ensuring that the code aligned with the initial design and minimized the risk of deviation or misinterpretation.

If I were to revise one part of my work on these documents, I would focus on enhancing the system architecture view section. While the template provides a reminder to describe the system and subsystem architecture, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed and specific description of the architecture, including physical components or tiers, as well as a logical topology of the communication and storage aspects. By providing a more comprehensive architectural view, it would offer a clearer understanding of the overall system design and aid in the development and implementation phases.

Interpreting the user's needs and implementing them into the software design was crucial to ensure that the final product met their expectations and provided a satisfying user experience. I carefully analyzed the client's requirements, business goals, and technical constraints, translating them into specific design decisions. I considered factors such as user engagement, ease of use, platform compatibility, and data security. By prioritizing the user's needs and designing the application accordingly, I aimed to create a game that would attract and retain players, offering an enjoyable and immersive gaming experience.

In approaching the software design, I followed a systematic approach that involved thorough analysis, planning, and documentation. I ensured that all requirements were captured and addressed, and I evaluated different operating platforms, considering their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. In the future, for similar software applications, it would be beneficial to incorporate agile development methodologies, such as iterative development and continuous feedback loops. This approach allows for more flexibility and adaptability during the development process, enabling quick iterations and adjustments based on user feedback and evolving requirements. Additionally, employing user-centered design principles, such as conducting user research, creating prototypes, and performing usability testing, would further enhance the user experience and overall success of the software application.
